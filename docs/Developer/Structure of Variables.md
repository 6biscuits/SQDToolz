# Structure of Variables

When running `ExperimentSpecification` objects, to prevent double-setting of instrument parameters (first by the CONFIG object and then by the SPEC object), the `ExperimentSpecification` targets are scanned and decomposed into their raw HAL instrument parameters. As a `Variable` object can be a target, the engine needs to know whether setting that `Variable` object will indirectly set some HAL instrument parameter; if so, it will override the value that would have been set by CONFIG. Although this could be theoretically inferred from scanning the entries in `_get_current_config`, it is a bit inconsistent in cases where one is simply reading from the `Variable` instead of setting it. Thus, light user input is required in implementing the `_get_written_targets` function which is to return a list of all `Variable` objects it sets and any HAL object parameters it sets (given as a tuple being the resolved list and the property name).
